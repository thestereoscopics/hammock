# Hammock Resources
These are the RESTful resources for which Hammock is going to provide CRUD routes. They are pretty much models in the traditional MVC sense.

Hammock uses Mongoid as for ORM'ing. Documentation about Mongoid Documents is available on the [Mongoid docs](http://mongoid.org/en/mongoid/docs/documents.html).
